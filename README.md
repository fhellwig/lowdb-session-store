# lowdb-session-store

Express session store using lowdb

# Installation

```
$ npm install lowdb-session-store
```

# Usage

This store implements all methods specified by the `express-session` store interface.

```javascript
const session = require('express-session');
const LowdbStore = require('lowdb-session-store')(session);
const lowdb = require('lowdb');
const FileSync = require('lowdb/adapters/FileSync');

// The default value must be an array.
const adapter = new FileSync(pathname, { defaultValue: [] });
const db = lowdb(adapter);
...

app.use(session({
  secret: '12345',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  store: new LowdbStore(db, {
    ttl: 86400
  })
}))
```

## Parameters

A new lowdb session store instance is created by instantiating the class returned by this module. The constructor takes one or two parameters:

- `db` - The first parameter must be a `lowdb` instance.

- `options` - An optional options object.

### Options

- `ttl` - The expiration time for a session in seconds. A interval timer runs every ten minutes to purge expired sessions. The default value is `86400` (one day).

## Session Storage Type

The value of the database **must** be an array as the sessions are stored as a collection.

If you want to store the sessions as a property of a larger object, you can do that provided that the property value is an array.

```javascript
const session = require('express-session');
const LowdbStore = require('lowdb-session-store')(session);
const lowdb = require('lowdb');
const FileSync = require('lowdb/adapters/FileSync');

// The sessions property must be an array.
const adapter = new FileSync(pathname, { defaultValue: { sessions: [] }});
const db = lowdb(adapter);
...

// We must get the sessions object before passing it to the session store.
app.use(session({
  secret: '12345',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  store: new LowdbStore(db.get('sessions'), {
    ttl: 86400
  })
}))
```

In this example, the sessions array is a property of an object. To make this work, you must get that structure and pass it as the database parameter to the session store.
